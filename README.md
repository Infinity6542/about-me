# Hi. I'm James.
This is my personal website. At the moment, it doesn't do much except introduce myself. In the future, I hope to add all ym collections of works, including photos and projects, to this.

## Features & Technologies
This project uses vanilla HTML, CSS and JS, with most animations being made with [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

## Credits, Attributions and Inspiration
### Fonts
The main font in this project (as with most of my other projects) is [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi), courtesy of the Indian Type Foundry.

The secondary font used for accents is [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display), licensed under the [Open Font License](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display/license).

## Follow-cursor
I first found the ball that follows your cursor on [Frederico Kratter Thaler's portfolio](https://www.kkratter.com/) a while back. I've expanded on the idea ever so slightly.
